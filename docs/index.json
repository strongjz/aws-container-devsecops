This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly. To generate this message, Docker took the following steps: 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon. 2. The Docker daemon pulled the \u0026#34;hello-world\u0026#34; image from the Docker Hub. (amd64) 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the executable that produces the output you are currently reading. 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it to your terminal. To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with: $ docker run -it ubuntu bash Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID: https://hub.docker.com/ For more examples and ideas, visit: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/ INSTALLING kind % Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed 100 98 100 98 0 0 267 0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 267 100 624 100 624 0 0 1116 0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 1116 100 6660k 100 6660k 0 0 5931k 0 0:00:01 0:00:01 --:--:-- 15.7M INSTALLING terraform Loaded plugins: extras_suggestions, langpacks, priorities, update-motd Existing lock /var/run/yum.pid: another copy is running as pid 25715.
